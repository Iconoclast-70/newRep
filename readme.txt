Evergrey was formed in 1995 in Gothenburg, Sweden as a progressive power metal band, outside of the melodic death metal part of the Gothenburg scene. Since then, the band's lyrics have always been of the darker sort, and the same can be said of the band's imagery. The Dark Discovery was recorded in 1996 and released in 1998, and Solitude, Dominance, Tragedy was recorded and released in 1999. While those two albums dealt with a variety of ideas, many later albums have been concept albums, dealing with issues like paranoia and alien abduction in In Search of Truth (2001).
